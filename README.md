# Car_Selling_Price_Prediction

As it is difficult to calculate what could be the sale price for used car by simply looking at the car certain features should be considered and model should be made using these features to find out the expected price of used car.

I took the following feature into account which are Car_Name,Year,Selling_Price,Present_Price,Kms_Driven,Fuel_Type,Seller_Type,Transmission	Owner to calculate the expected price of used car by using Random Forest Algorithm.

This is an End to End machine learning model built by creating separate environment using Anaconda and using Spyder,Flask framework to built the final model at the end the deployment of the model is performed in the Heroku platform which helps to calculate the final price of used car.
